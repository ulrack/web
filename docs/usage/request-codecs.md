# Ulrack Web - Request codecs

By default, Ulrack implements a set of codec for configurations. Due to the
nature of YAML, it is insecure by default, because it allows statements that
can be evaluated. Due to this reason, codecs for the web package are separately
configured. By default only the JSON codec is defined.
